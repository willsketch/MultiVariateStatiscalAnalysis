The choice of the distance metric can significantly affect the performance of these algorithms, as they often rely on capturing the relationships between nearby data points. When data is projected into a lower-dimensional space, preserving local structure (i.e., distances between neighboring points) is essential to ensure that the reduced representation reflects the true geometry of the original data.\n",

It assumes that the data lies in a space where this straight-line measurement accurately reflects the relationships between points. Euclidean distance is widely applicable, especially when the geometry of the data matters.\n",
        "*   Cosine Distance: Cosine distance measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. This metric is particularly useful in high-dimensional spaces (e.g., text analysis or word embeddings), where the magnitude of the vectors is less important than their direction. Cosine distance helps capture the similarity between objects based on their orientation rather than absolute magnitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Jaccard Distance: Used to measure dissimilarity between two sets, Jaccard distance is useful for binary or categorical data. It quantifies the ratio of non-overlapping elements in the two sets. This metric is especially helpful in scenarios like comparing user preferences or attributes of items in recommendation systems.\n",

        "Also called relative entropy, KL divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions. It is especially useful in machine learning tasks involving probability distributions, such as in information theory or Bayesian models. Unlike symmetric distance measures, KL divergence is not a true distance metric because it is asymmetric (i.e., KL(p||q) \\neq KL(q||p)).\n",
        "* UniFrac: This is a specialized distance metric designed for comparing biological communities. It takes into account the phylogenetic relationships between species, allowing the comparison of communities based on their evolutionary distances. It’s frequently used in ecological and microbiome studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Similarity Metrics**:\n",

It is especially well-suited for visualizing high-dimensional datasets by reducing them to two or three dimensions while preserving the local structure of the data.\n",

It then defines a similar probability distribution for the points in the lower-dimensional embedding. The algorithm tries to minimize the difference (Kullback-Leibler divergence) between these two probability distributions, effectively positioning similar points together in the low-dimensional space."

Unfortunately, that very flexibility makes it tricky to interpret. Out of sight from the user, the algorithm makes all sorts of adjustments that tidy up its visualizations. Don’t let the hidden “magic” scare you away from the whole technique, though. The good news is that by studying how t-SNE behaves in simple cases, it’s possible to develop an intuition for what’s going on.\n",
